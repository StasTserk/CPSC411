% This file demonstrates the various quirky behaviours expected of comments.

first there are a few normal tokens /*then there are potential tokens 
that should not be included*/ these tokens should be included

corner case where comments/*may have no surrounding whitespace*/possibly cause two tokens to be joined

/* now we have the case where comments may be nested
/* this second level sould be excluded */
 this should also be excluded */
this should be fine though

/* this next section shows the priority of single line comment sections
where normally % this next bit would close the comment */
and these tokens would show up, but because it's preceeded by the SLC char
this is what closes the comment */
